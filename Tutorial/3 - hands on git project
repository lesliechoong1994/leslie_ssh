- create a new merge request

what is merge request?
- let say default branch (master branch) is our main repo. It should be the most legit repo to all of us.
- you have one more step call merge request to overwrite the default branch 
    - change from local branch -> merge request -> requesting someone to review your code -> merge to master branch
- to ensure every change to the repo is reviewed and compared properly before it is merged.
