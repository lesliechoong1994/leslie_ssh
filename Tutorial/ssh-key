Why do you need a ssh-keygen? 
1) for authentication purpose.
2) directly interact from local machine with repo without requesting for your password/username
    - after you edit the script from local, you can do git pull, git add ., git commit, git push from local machine

what you can't do with ssh-keygen?
1) pull merge request 
2) code review
p/s: You can only do both of them in github repo.
